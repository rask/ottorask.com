I decided to start a Patreon page in order to help me find more funds and time
to make more music. It’s simple:
{{ link(label="check out my Patreon page", url="https://www.patreon.com/ojrask", external=true) }},
and then become a patron (minimum $1.00 per month) if you feel like you want to
support me.

I’ve been doing electronic music for around a decade mainly for myself. Now I’m
in the phase where I feel like I could step it up a bit and aim a tad higher. I
will be keeping true to myself, and hopefully, I will find people who share my
style and like what I put out.

## Patreon?

{{ link(label="Patreon", url="https://www.patreon.com", external=true) }} is a
website where creators can reach our for new fans, supporters, and followers.
Fans and supporters pay either per-creation (e.g. a single song or album) or
then per-month.

Patreon makes it easier for freelancers and single-person creator teams to earn
some revenue and grow their fanbase.

## Why did I start a Patreon page?

-   I love making music
-   I would love to make more music
-   I would love to make better music

Right now I’m in a spot where I work on my music in the evenings and weekends.
My dream would be to partly cover my living expenses by making awesome music.
The more time I can sink into making music the better I will become, and the
better stuff you will also get to your speakers and headphones! Who knows,
perhaps one day you would hear one of my tracks at a festival somewhere. Or
just maybe even a local club, even that would be awesome.

## Why should you become a patron?

-   I get a certain amount of support per month, which helps me cover costs of
    making music and living my life
-   Get access to early previews and other special content from me, be it track
    previews or work in progress clips
-   You can keep your monthly donations as low as $1.00, or show more financial
    support if you feel like it
-   A warm and fuzzy feeling inside.

I don’t have any reward tiers yet, but I’m open to suggestions for rewards. Some
people do commissions, some provide neat patrons-only content, some shell out
merch.

In any case, I would really appreciate the support, be it big or small. Thanks!
