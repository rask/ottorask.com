{{ link(label="ChatGPT", url="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/", external=true) }} is all the rage right now. I decided to try it out a bit. Eventually I wanted to see how it expands on knowledge we can verify exists, with something else we may ot may not agree about.

ChatGPT of course is just a conversational interface built on top of the GPT-content generation toolkit and datasets. I have never before interacted with OpenAI tooling, so this was my first foray into trying things out, and this is perhaps not what the chatbot is all about, as it can be more of a team member for you in the absence of a real person.

I was intrigued about what kind of knowledge the dataset holds, and wanted to see whether the bot would give me plausible content that infuses the Agile Manifesto contents with insights regarding mob programming.

My initial prompt was

> I would need a text where we take the 12 principles of the agile manifesto, and open each principle a little more in terms of a team practicing mob programming, possible?

To which the bot replied properly until it somehow cut off at priciple 8. I then reposted my prompt, modified to ask for the rest:

> That one cut off, I would need a text where we take the principles 8 through 12 of the agile manifesto, and open each principle a little more in terms of a team practicing mob programming, possible?

And here are the results which I pieced together to form all the 12 principles together:

> Sure, here is a possible text that expands on the 12 principles of the Agile Manifesto in relation to a team practicing mob programming:
> 
> 1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software. In a team practicing mob programming, this principle can be achieved by working together on a single task at the same time, which can help to ensure that valuable features are implemented quickly and efficiently. By continuously collaborating and sharing ideas, the team can identify and prioritize the most important features for the customer, and work together to implement them in a timely manner.
> 2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage. In a team practicing mob programming, this principle can be achieved by being flexible and adaptable to changing requirements and priorities. Because the team is working together in real-time, it can quickly respond to changes and adjust its plans and approach as needed. By embracing change and using it to the customer's advantage, the team can deliver more valuable and relevant software.
> 3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale. In a team practicing mob programming, this principle can be achieved by working together on small, focused tasks and delivering them frequently. By breaking down the project into smaller chunks and working on them collaboratively, the team can deliver working software more quickly and frequently, which can help to ensure that the customer is satisfied and the project stays on track.
> 4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. In a team practicing mob programming, this principle is inherent in the approach, as the entire team works together on a single task at the same time. By bringing together business people and developers in this way, the team can ensure that everyone is aligned on the project goals and priorities, and that there is a shared understanding of the customer's needs and expectations. This can help to foster better collaboration and communication within the team, and can lead to more successful outcomes for the project.
> 5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. In a team practicing mob programming, this principle can be achieved by providing a supportive and collaborative environment in which team members can work together effectively. By giving team members the tools and support they need, and by trusting them to do their best work, the team can foster a sense of motivation and ownership, which can lead to better results and more satisfied team members.
> 6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation. In a team practicing mob programming, this principle is also inherent in the approach, as the team is working together on a single task at the same time, using face-to-face conversation to share ideas and collaborate. By using this method of communication, the team can ensure that everyone is on the same page, and that information is conveyed quickly and effectively.
> 7. Working software is the primary measure of progress. In a team practicing mob programming, this principle can be achieved by focusing on delivering working software frequently, as described in principle 3. By prioritizing the delivery of working software, the team can ensure that progress is being made and that the customer's needs are being met. This can help to keep the project on track and can provide a clear and tangible measure of success.
> 8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. In a team practicing mob programming, this principle can be achieved by working together on small, focused tasks and delivering them frequently, as described in principle 3. By breaking down the project into manageable chunks and working on them collaboratively, the team can maintain a sustainable pace and avoid burnout or fatigue. This can help to ensure that the team is able to continue working at a high level of productivity and quality over the long term.
> 9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. In a team practicing mob programming, this principle can be achieved by working together on a single task at the same time, which can facilitate a more focused and disciplined approach to technical excellence and good design. By continuously sharing ideas and collaborating on the implementation of the code, the team can ensure that the code is of high quality, is well-designed, and is maintainable over time. This can help to improve the agility of the team and to ensure that it is able to adapt to changing requirements and priorities.
> 10. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential. In a team practicing mob programming, this principle can be achieved by working together on a single task at the same time, which can help to identify and eliminate unnecessary work. By continuously discussing and debating different approaches, the team can identify the simplest and most effective solutions, and avoid wasting time and effort on unnecessary or irrelevant tasks. This can help to improve the efficiency and productivity of the team, and can lead to better results for the customer.
> 11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. In a team practicing mob programming, this principle can be achieved by working together on a single task at the same time, which can facilitate a more collaborative and self-organizing approach to architecture, requirements, and design. By continuously sharing ideas and collaborating on the implementation of the code, the team can identify and refine the best solutions, and can evolve the architecture, requirements, and design as needed to meet the changing needs of the project. This can help to ensure that the team is able to deliver the most valuable and relevant software to the customer.
> 12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly. In a team practicing mob programming, this principle can be achieved by regularly taking time to reflect on the team's progress and effectiveness, and to make any necessary adjustments to the way the team is working. By continuously collaborating and sharing ideas, the team can identify areas for improvement and can take action to address them. This can help to ensure that the team is always striving to become more effective and to deliver the best possible results for the customer.

A bit repetitive in places, as the content generation algorithm keeps looping and thinking that each principle requires a wholly new treatment of introductory text content and so on. But what we can see, is that the bot can actually form cohesive points about how mob programming might be of help when we want to work according to the twelve principles of agile software development.

But when you read it over again and again, it looks more and more like the bot synthesized random knowledge about each principle or product development, and merely just adopted the mobbing words and practises to suit it's response to my prompt preoprly. The bot does not think nor does it know, it merely finds correlations and patterns in text content and forms new things that match the patterns and correlations in some way or form. Words that appear often together will end up in the same response. Words that are used to describe similar things are used to describe a new thing that kind of seems like the earlier two similar although different things. Such is the way of "AI".

No matter how much I agree with what the bot wrote, I still should not trust the content as something "true" or "researched". I must read it through as I would read through any new content I come across: critical thinking and reflecting on what I already know and what knowledgeable people on the topic know.

And of course, as always with things like this, we run into the trap of {{ link(label="confirmation bias", url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias#Biased_search_for_information", external=true) }}. When I formed my prompt, I set the question in a way that the bot will form answers that make mob programming seem like a net positive for agile development ideals. How about when we form the prompt to ask how mobbing might affect things negatively?

(For some reason this time around the bot kept choking and cutting off more often, and I had to ask for the last 5 principles one-by-one, which resulted in longer answers for each individual principle. I've pieced together my prompt and the bot's answer below.)

My prompt:

> I would need a text where we take the 12 principles of the agile manifesto, and open each principle a little more in terms of how mob programming might make it harder to follow each principle, possible?

To which the bot replied with:

> Sure, here is a possible text that expands on the 12 principles of the Agile Manifesto in relation to how mob programming might make it harder to follow each principle:
> 
> 1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software. In a team practicing mob programming, this principle may be harder to follow if the team is not well-coordinated or if there are disagreements or conflicts within the team. Because the team is working together on a single task at the same time, any issues or challenges that arise can quickly impact the team's ability to deliver valuable software to the customer. It is important for the team to have effective communication and collaboration, and to address any conflicts or challenges in a timely and constructive manner, in order to ensure that the customer's needs are met.
> 2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage. In a team practicing mob programming, this principle may be harder to follow if the team is not flexible and adaptable, or if there are communication or coordination challenges within the team. Because the team is working together on a single task at the same time, it is important for the team to be able to respond quickly to changing requirements and priorities, and to adjust its plans and approach as needed. If the team is not able to adapt to change in a timely and effective manner, it may miss opportunities to harness change to the customer's advantage.
> 3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale. In a team practicing mob programming, this principle may be harder to follow if the team is not able to break down the project into small, focused tasks, or if there are issues with coordination or communication within the team. Because the team is working together on a single task at the same time, it is important for the team to be able to deliver working software frequently, in order to keep the project on track and to satisfy the customer. If the team is not able to do this, it may miss opportunities to make progress and to deliver valuable software to the customer.
> 4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. In a team practicing mob programming, this principle may be harder to follow if there are misunderstandings or misalignment between the business people and developers, or if there are communication or coordination challenges within the team. Because the team is working together on a single task at the same time, it is important for the team to have a shared understanding of the project goals and priorities, and to be aligned on the customer's needs and expectations. If the team is not able to achieve this level of alignment and collaboration, it may be difficult to deliver the most valuable and relevant software to the customer.
> 5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. In a team practicing mob programming, this principle may be harder to follow if there are issues with morale or motivation within the team, or if there are communication or coordination challenges within the team. Because the team is working together on a single task at the same time, it is important for the team to feel motivated and supported, and to have the tools and resources they need to do their best work. If the team is not able to achieve this level of motivation and support, it may be difficult for the team to deliver high-quality software to the customer.
> 6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation. In a team practicing mob programming, this principle may be harder to follow if there are communication or coordination challenges within the team, or if team members are not able to engage in effective face-to-face conversation. Because the team is working together on a single task at the same time, it is important for the team to be able to communicate and collaborate effectively, in order to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that information is conveyed quickly and efficiently. If the team is not able to achieve this level of communication and collaboration, it may be difficult for the team to deliver the most valuable and relevant software to the customer.

Because the team is working together on a single task at the same time, it is important for the team to be able to deliver working software on a regular basis, in order to ensure that progress is being made and that the customer's needs are being met. If the team is not able to deliver working software frequently, it may be difficult for the team to measure its progress and to make adjustments as needed.
> 8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. In a team practicing mob programming, this principle may be harder to follow if the team is not able to maintain a sustainable pace, or if there are communication or coordination challenges within the team. Because the team is working together on a single task at the same time, it is important for the team to be able to maintain a consistent level of productivity and quality over the long term, in order to avoid burnout or fatigue. If the team is not able to sustain its pace, or if there are issues that impact the team's ability to work together effectively, it may be difficult for the team to deliver the most valuable and relevant software to the customer. It is important for the team to have effective communication and collaboration, and to address any challenges or conflicts in a timely and constructive manner, in order to ensure that the team is able to maintain a sustainable pace and deliver high-quality software to the customer.
> 9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. In a team practicing mob programming, this principle may be harder to follow if the team is not focused and disciplined in its approach to technical excellence and good design, or if there are communication or coordination challenges within the team. Because the team is working together on a single task at the same time, it is important for the team to be able to maintain a high level of focus and discipline, in order to ensure that the code is of high quality, is well-designed, and is maintainable over time.

> 12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly. In a team practicing mob programming, this principle may be harder to follow if the team is not able to reflect on its work and make improvements, or if there are communication or coordination challenges within the team. Because the team is working together on a single task at the same time, it is important for the team to be able to take regular breaks, to reflect on its work, and to identify opportunities for improvement. If the team is not able to achieve this level of reflection and improvement, or if there are issues that impact the team's ability to work together effectively, it may be difficult for the team to deliver high-quality software to the customer. It is important for the team to have effective communication and collaboration, and to address any challenges or conflicts in a timely and constructive manner, in order to ensure that the team is able to reflect on its work and make continuous improvements, and to deliver the most valuable and relevant software to the customer.

Not sure if it was the wording in my prompt or the bot getting bored of me, but the responses this time seemed very much like the bot kept repeating the same thing but with a just slightly different wording for each principle. This one took quite a bit time so I didn't want to spend any more time wringing out something more cohesive of an answer.

Disclaimer: I do not know where the bot pulled all these text contents from, either verbatim or by paraphrasing multiple sources.
