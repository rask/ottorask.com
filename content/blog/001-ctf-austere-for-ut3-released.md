I’m pleased to write that my award winning Capture The Flag level for Unreal
Tournament 3 has been finalized and released.

_(there was an image here at some point, now internet has lost it)_

CTF-Austere is a level in an neglected industrial setting, partly mimicking the
old-school Unreal Tournament 1 theme. The layout is quite straight-forward, with
a few routes and enough z-axis to keep you busy chasing the other team’s flag.
Enough close quarter combat areas for some tight Flak Cannon action and a few
open spots for long-range sniping, and everything in between.

Powerups include all possible armors scattered around the level and two useful
invisibility pickups. If you time it right, you could double the invisibility
time and sneak to the enemy flag quite well. All weapons (except for the
redeemer) are included and a balanced ammo layout is in use, leaving enough for
a good 14 player match.

Visuals consist of dark and murky abaddoned industrial assets and effects.
Leaking pipes, croaking wood, overflown pits and howling wind and unfirendly
rain from open ceilings. You can hear the distant thunder occasionally. The map
uses no music, but I think I created a good aural world to the level to
compensate to that. Add in the shrieks and bangs of fierce battle and you’ve got
the audio finished. In the below download I’ve included a music track I
originally made for this level, but left out in the end.

Originally I created Austere just for myself and to get a level done for Unreal
Tournament 3. Later on when interest grew I decided to please the other players
too and began taking feedback on various beta versions. In the credits listed
below you read the folks that made Austere a great level in my opinion. Thanks
folks!

I sent an almost finished version to the UT3 iteration of Make Something Unreal
Contest to try my skills in the level development categories. To my pure
surprise, Austere was picked fifth in the ‘Best DM/CTF level’ category in the
Phase three submissions, which is quite a feat for a first level for a game in
my scope.

Below are some screenshots and download links.

Download (a 42,3MB .zip-file) available from these locations: none any more,
sorry. Let me know and I can dig a ZIP for you.

I would like to own some credit to these people (list below), who were of help
when developing CTF-Austere or otherwise posted kind comments into the beta
version threads at various discussion boards or via direct contact. Thanks
everyone and Epic Games for a great game!
