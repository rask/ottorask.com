My name is Otto Rask. I’m a Finnish software engineer and I work at a Finnish
digital service solutions provider called [Sofokus](https://www.sofokus.com).

When I’m not working, I’m working (heh) on my own projects which usually relate
to programming and computing. My open source stuff is available over at
[GitHub](https://github.com/rask).

Other hobbies and activities include gaming, music and random arts.
