My name is Otto Rask. I’m from Finland and I am a &hellip;

When I’m not working, I’m working (heh) on my own projects or helping out with
other folks' open source projects. My open source stuff is available over at
{{ link(label="GitHub", url="https://github.com/rask", external=true) }}.

I mainly work with PHP, sometimes Python, sometimes Rust. Continuous integration
and continuous deployment, devops methodologies, and automation are things that
are close to my heart as well. I also know my way around servers and cloud
providers.

## Hobbyist music producer

On my free time I like to produce electronic music for my own pleasure. My style
varies greatly, as does the quality. I hope you'll like it too.

## Mechanical keyhoarder

I like mechanical keyboards. I have, like, _a dozen_.

Tactile switches, ANSI-layout, 60ish% form factor, and self-built is my favorite
setup. Cherry profile is the best keycap profile.

keyboard meetups and co-founded a local

## PC gamer

I've been playing PC games since I was a little kid in the 90s. I still play
PC games. I'm a really casual gamer these days, but I do know how to kick your
ass (or parts of it) in Unreal Tournament if need be.

Sometimes I've been thinking about making games, but nothing has come of it yet.
